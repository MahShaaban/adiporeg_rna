  Volume = {45},
  Year = {2017},
  Abstract = {The KDM5 family of histone demethylases removes the H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) mark frequently found at promoter regions of actively transcribed genes and is therefore generally considered to contribute to corepression. In this study, we show that knockdown (KD) of all expressed members of the KDM5 family in white and brown preadipocytes leads to deregulated gene expression and blocks differentiation to mature adipocytes. KDM5 KD leads to a considerable increase in H3K4me3 at promoter regions; however, these changes in H3K4me3 have a limited effect on gene expression per se. By contrast, genome-wide analyses demonstrate that KDM5A is strongly enriched at KDM5-activated promoters, which generally have high levels of H3K4me3 and are associated with highly expressed genes. We show that KDM5-activated genes include a large set of cell cycle regulators and that the KDM5s are necessary for mitotic clonal expansion in 3T3-L1 cells, indicating that KDM5 KD may interfere with differentiation in part by impairing proliferation. Notably, the demethylase activity of KDM5A is required for activation of at least a subset of pro-proliferative cell cycle genes. In conclusion, the KDM5 family acts as dual modulators of gene expression in preadipocytes and is required for early stage differentiation and activation of pro-proliferative cell cycle genes.},

  Volume = {290},
  Year = {2015},
  Abstract = {The glucose transporter GLUT4 facilitates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in peripheral tissues including adipose, muscle, and heart. GLUT4 function is impaired in obesity and type 2 diabetes leading to hyperglycemia and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and neuropathy. To understand better the regulation of GLUT4 function, a targeted siRNA screen was performed and led to the discovery that ZFP407 regulates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. The decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake due to ZFP407 deficiency was attributed to a reduction in GLUT4 mRNA and protein levels. The decrease in GLUT4 was due to both decreased transcription of Glut4 mRNA and decreased efficiency of Glut4 pre-mRNA splicing. Interestingly, ZFP407 coordinately regulated this decrease in transcription with an increase in the stability of Glut4 mRNA, resulting in opposing effects on steady-state Glut4 mRNA levels. More broadly, transcriptome analysis revealed that ZFP407 regulates many PPAR$\gamma$ target genes beyond Glut4. ZFP407 was required for the PPAR$\gamma$ agonist Rosiglitazone to increase Glut4 expression, but was not sufficient to increase expression of a PPAR$\gamma$ target gene reporter construct. However, ZFP407 and PPAR$\gamma$ co-overexpression synergistically activated a PPAR$\gamma$ reporter construct beyond the level of PPAR$\gamma$ alone. Thus, ZFP407 may represent a new modulator of the PPAR$\gamma$ signaling pathway.},

Insulin resistance can be induced in cultured adipocytes by a variety of treatments, but what aspects of the invivo responses are captured by these models remains unknown. We use global RNA sequencing to investigate changes induced by TNF-$\alpha$, hypoxia, dexamethasone, high insulin, and a combination of TNF-$\alpha$ and hypoxia, comparing the results to the changes in white adipose tissue from DIO mice. We found that different invitro models capture distinct features of DIO adipose insulin resistance, and a combined treatment of TNF-$\alpha$ and hypoxia is most able to mimic the invivo changes. Using genome-wide DNase I hypersensitivity followed by sequencing, we further examined the transcriptional regulation of TNF-$\alpha$-induced insulin resistance, and we found that C/EPB$\beta$ is a potential key regulator of adipose insulin resistance},

  Abstract = {Transcriptional regulators are crucial in adipocyte differentiation. We now show that the homeodomain- containing transcription factor Prep1 is a repressor of adipogenic differentiation since its down- regulation (DR) in both ex vivo bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and in vitro 3T3-L1 preadipocytes significantly increases their adipogenic differentiation ability. Prep1 acts at a stage preceding the activation of the differentiation machinery because its DR makes cells more prone to adipogenic differentiation even in the absence of the adipogenic inducers. Prep1 DR expands the DNA binding landscape of C/EBP$\beta$ (CCAAT enhancer binding protein $\beta$) without affecting its expression or activation. The data indicate that Prep1 normally acts by restricting DNA binding of transcription factors to adipogenic enhancers, in particular C/EBP$\beta$.},

  Abstract = {Insulin activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) regulates metabolism, including the translocation of the Glut4 glucose transporter to the plasma membrane and inactivation of the FoxO1 transcription factor. Adenoviral protein E4-ORF1 stimulates cellular glucose metabolism by mimicking growth-factor activation of PI3K. We have used E4-ORF1 as a tool to dissect PI3K-mediated signaling in adipocytes. E4-ORF1 activation of PI3K in adipocytes recapitulates insulin regulation of FoxO1 but not regulation of Glut4. This uncoupling of PI3K effects occurs despite E4-ORF1 activating PI3K and downstream signaling to levels achieved by insulin. Although E4-ORF1 does not fully recapitulate insulin's effects on Glut4, it enhances insulin-stimulated insertion of Glut4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane independent of Rab10, a key regulator of Glut4 trafficking. E4-ORF1 also stimulates plasma membrane translocation of ubiquitously expressed Glut1 glucose transporter, an effect that is likely essential for E4-ORF1 to promote an anabolic metabolism in a broad range of cell types.},

  Abstract = {Increasing energy expenditure through brown adipocyte recruitment is a promising approach to combat obesity. We report here the comprehensive profiling of the epigenome and transcriptome throughout the lineage commitment and differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cell line into brown adipocytes. Through direct comparison to datasets from differentiating white adipocytes, we systematically identify stage- and lineage-specific coding genes, lncRNAs and microRNAs. Utilizing chromatin state maps, we also define stage- and lineage-specific enhancers, including super-enhancers, and their associated transcription factor binding motifs and genes. Through these analyses, we found that in brown adipocytes, brown lineage-specific genes are pre-marked by both H3K4me1 and H3K27me3, and the removal of H3K27me3 at the late stage is necessary but not sufficient to promote brown gene expression, while the pre-deposition of H3K4me1 plays an essential role in poising the brown genes for expression in mature brown cells. Moreover, we identify SOX13 as part of a p38 MAPK dependent transcriptional response mediating early brown cell lineage commitment. We also identify and subsequently validate PIM1, SIX1 and RREB1 as novel regulators promoting brown adipogenesis. Finally, we show that SIX1 binds to adipogenic and brown marker genes and interacts with C/EBP$\alpha$, C/EBP$\beta$ and EBF2, suggesting their functional cooperation during adipogenesis.},

  Abstract = {Transcription factors have recently been shown to colocalize in hotspot regions of the genome, which are further clustered into super-enhancers. However, the detailed molecular organization of transcription factors at hotspot regions is poorly defined. Here, we have used digital genomic footprinting to precisely define factor localization at a genome-wide level during the early phase of 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation, which allows us to obtain detailed molecular insight into how transcription factors target hotspots. We demonstrate the formation of ATF-C/EBP heterodimers at a composite motif on chromatin, and we suggest that this may be a general mechanism for integrating external signals on chromatin. Furthermore, we find evidence of extensive recruitment of transcription factors to hotspots through alternative mechanisms not involving their known motifs and demonstrate that these alternative binding events are functionally important for hotspot formation and activity. Taken together, these findings provide a framework for understanding transcription factor cooperativity in hotspots. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

  Volume = {67},
  Year = {2018},
  Abstract = {The gene encoding for transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) is the strongest type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) candidate gene discovered to date. The TCF7L2 protein is a key transcriptional effector of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway, which is an important developmental pathway that negatively regulates adipogenesis. However, the precise role that TCF7L2 plays in the development and function of adipocytes remains largely unknown. Using a combination of in vitro approaches, we first show that TCF7L2 protein is increased during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and primary adipocyte stem cells and that TCF7L2 expression is required for the regulation of Wnt signaling during adipogenesis. Inactivation of TCF7L2 protein by removing the high-mobility group (HMG)-box DNA binding domain in mature adipocytes in vivo leads to whole-body glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin resistance. This phenotype is associated with increased subcutaneous adipose tissue mass, adipocyte hypertrophy, and inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that TCF7L2 mRNA expression is downregulated in humans with impaired glucose tolerance and adipocyte insulin resistance, highlighting the translational potential of these findings. In summary, our data indicate that TCF7L2 has key roles in adipose tissue development and function that may reveal, at least in part, how TCF7L2 contributes to the pathophysiology of T2DM.},

  Abstract = {The role of Fat Mass and Obesity-associated protein (FTO) and its substrate N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA processing and adipogenesis remains largely unknown. We show that FTO expression and m6A levels are inversely correlated during adipogenesis. FTO depletion blocks differentiation and only catalytically active FTO restores adipogenesis. Transcriptome analyses in combination with m6A-seq revealed that gene expression and mRNA splicing of grouped genes are regulated by FTO. M6A is enriched in exonic regions flanking 5'- and 3'-splice sites, spatially overlapping with mRNA splicing regulatory serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein exonic splicing enhancer binding regions. Enhanced levels of m6A in response to FTO depletion promotes the RNA binding ability of SRSF2 protein, leading to increased inclusion of target exons. FTO controls exonic splicing of adipogenic regulatory factor RUNX1T1 by regulating m6A levels around splice sites and thereby modulates differentiation. These findings provide compelling evidence that FTO-dependent m6A demethylation functions as a novel regulatory mechanism of RNA processing and plays a critical role in the regulation of adipogenesis.},

  Abstract = {The proteins that coordinate complex adipogenic transcriptional networks are poorly understood. 14-3-3$\zeta$ is a molecular adaptor protein that regulates insulin signalling and transcription factor networks. Here we report that 14-3-3$\zeta$-knockout mice are strikingly lean from birth with specific reductions in visceral fat depots. Conversely, transgenic 14-3-3$\zeta$ overexpression potentiates obesity, without exacerbating metabolic complications. Only the 14-3-3$\zeta$ isoform is essential for adipogenesis based on isoform-specific RNAi. Mechanistic studies show that 14-3-3$\zeta$ depletion promotes autophagy-dependent degradation of C/EBP-$\delta$, preventing induction of the master adipogenic factors, Ppar$\gamma$ and C/EBP-$\alpha$. Transcriptomic data indicate that 14-3-3$\zeta$ acts upstream of hedgehog signalling-dependent upregulation of Cdkn1b/p27(Kip1). Indeed, concomitant knockdown of p27(Kip1) or Gli3 rescues the early block in adipogenesis induced by 14-3-3$\zeta$ knockdown in vitro. Adipocyte precursors in 14-3-3$\zeta$KO embryos also appear to have greater Gli3 and p27(Kip1) abundance. Together, our in vivo and in vitro findings demonstrate that 14-3-3$\zeta$ is a critical upstream driver of adipogenesis.},

Here, we use promoter capture Hi-C to demonstrate a rapid reorganization of promoter-anchored chromatin loops within 4 hr after inducing differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The establishment of new promoter-enhancer loops is tightly coupled to activation of poised (histone H3 lysine 4 mono- and dimethylated) enhancers, as evidenced by the acquisition of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation and the binding of MED1, SMC1, and P300 proteins to these regions, as well as to activation of target genes. Intriguingly, formation of loops connecting activated enhancers and promoters is also associated with extensive recruitment of corepressors such as NCoR and HDACs, indicating that this class of coregulators may play a previously unrecognized role during enhancer activation.},

  Title = {LSD1 promotes oxidative metabolism of white adipose tissue},
  Volume = {5},
  Year = {2014},
  Abstract = {Exposure to environmental cues such as cold or nutritional imbalance requires white adipose tissue (WAT) to adapt its metabolism to ensure survival. Metabolic plasticity is prominently exemplified by the enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis in WAT in response to cold exposure or $\beta$3-adrenergic stimulation. Here we show that these stimuli increase the levels of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) in WAT of mice and that elevated LSD1 levels induce mitochondrial activity. Genome-wide binding and transcriptome analyses demonstrate that LSD1 directly stimulates the expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cooperation with nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1). In transgenic (Tg) mice, increased levels of LSD1 promote in a cell-autonomous manner the formation of islets of metabolically active brown-like adipocytes in WAT. Notably, Tg mice show limited weight gain when fed a high-fat diet. Taken together, our data establish LSD1 as a key regulator of OXPHOS and metabolic adaptation in WAT.},
